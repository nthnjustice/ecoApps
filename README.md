#### Goal: 
A computational tool used to investigate tipping points and early warning signals in simulations of ecosystem models

#### Method: 
Multiple [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web applications, where each app simulates a different ecological model

# Instructions for launching locally:

1) [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)

2) [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3) Clone this repository to your desktop using the terminal commands:
